# Introduction
Customer lifetime value (CLV, or CLTV) is a metric that indicates the total revenue a business can reasonably expect from a single customer account throughout the business relationship.
# Why is CLV Important?

* Increasing CLV can increase revenue over time.
* It helps you target your ideal customers.
* Increasing CLV also helps reduce your customer acquisition cost.
 
   Now that we understand the importance of customer lifetime value, letâ€™s predict customer 
   lifetime value using Python.

In this project,We will predict Customer Lifetime Value using a Buy Till You Die (in this case, we will use BG/NBD) model to predict the number of purchases based on Poisson distribution and the Gamma Gamma Model to predict the average amount in the future.
We will utilize the lifetimes module to create our unique dataset and predict customer lifetime value. 
# The Dataset
We will use an Online Retail dataset in order to predict clv.
i have downloaded the Dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/online-retail-dataset
